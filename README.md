ðŸ˜„ I am a graduate student at Zhejiang University and now I am a visiting student at the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science(AMSS), Chinese Academy of Sciences.
ðŸ”­ I am working on solving the problem of surface-surface-intersection and how to use parallel and GPU to implement the algorithm(I'm very sorry that this part of the code will not be open source for the time being).
ðŸŒ± I am also interested in microservices and I have worked as a game server intern at ByteDance-Jiangnan Game Studio for eight months. (And my nickname is Xiaoxiao~)
